            <p> My hobby is reading both, interesting and knowledgeable books. After completing my home work and Whitehat Jr projects I just like to read books. Now I know that reading books have a mountain of advantages, I will list a few- Reading enhances your vocabulary, Boosts your imagination, Makes you enter a world full of knowledge and facts and fantasy. Back to me, I love the Adventurous books of Geronimo Stilton because whenever I read them I make a beautiful world of my own in my mind. And of course I love reading knowledgeable books like Books on History, Science etc. Reading books is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge and inspiration. It makes us disciplned, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life. </p>
            <h4> HAPPY READING! </h4>

                <p> Although all the books of the Geronimo Stilton Series written by Elisabetta Maria Dami are my Favourite Books, I love "The Quest for Paradise, The Return to the Kingdom of Fantasy" book the most which is also authored by Elisabetta Maria Dami. I like this book the most because in this book Geronimo travels all the Seven Rainbow Kingdoms of Fantasy with his Friends!  </p>
